<Our boggle program, runs according to the boggle game rules, it has a clock, which we have done in a very intuitive
 that doesn't require any external libraries such as time or what not, additionally we created the buttons all the
 needed buttons and labels to play the game, with sizes and fonts clear and readable for the user. Also we created a
  quit button that exists the program and remove button, which acts like the backspace key in the keyboard
  and a start button, which from it's name starts the game. We also put a boggle icon in place of the tk default icon.
  When the user, chooses a word then clicks the "check" button if the word is correct it is put in a listbox showing
  the chosen correct words and the  latest picked word will always be on top. When the time ends, a messagebox
  will be shown to the user showing whether or not he wants to play again or no.>
